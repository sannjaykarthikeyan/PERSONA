Created for my computer science culminating project. 


Inspired by the Persona RPG series, PERSONA is a turn-based action adventure game created in Java. 
On their first day of school, three friends encounter a series of "shadows" in various dungeons and palaces. By utilizing their Personas, allies with special abilities, they
work together to escape an alternate reality and save the day.
